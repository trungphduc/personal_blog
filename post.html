                <p>Most Americans drink coffee every day. The caffeine in coffee helps us stay alert but also may
                    cause jitteriness and interfere with sleeping</p>

                <p>Coffee does more than boost your energy. A few daily cups of coffee may also lower your risk of type
                    2 diabetes and depression, support weight management, and help you live a longer life. Just keep in
                    mind that experts recommend limiting caffeine if you are pregnant or nursing.</p>

                <p>Coffee contains caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that is known for its ability to fight
                    fatigue and increase energy levels .<br>
                    This is because caffeine blocks the receptors of a neurotransmitter called adenosine, and this
                    increases levels of other neurotransmitters in your brain that regulate your energy levels,
                    including dopamine.One small study found that consuming caffeine increased time to exhaustion during
                    a cycling exercise by 12% and significantly reduced subjective levels of fatigue in participant
                </p>
                <h3 class="sub-title">Could support brain health</h3>
                <p>Although studies have turned up mixed results, some research suggests that coffee may help protect
                    against certain neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.
                    According to one review of 13 studies, people who regularly consumed caffeine had a significantly
                    lower risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. What’s more, caffeine consumption also slowed the
                    progression of Parkinson’s disease over time</p>
                <blockquote>“Some research suggests that drinking coffee could help protect against Alzheimer’s disease,
                    Parkinson’s disease, and cognitive decline.”</blockquote>

                <h3 class="sub-title">May promote weight management</h3>
                <p>According to some research, coffee could alter fat storage and support gut health, both of which may
                    be beneficial for weight management.
                    For example, one review of 12 studies concluded that higher coffee consumption could be associated
                    with decreased body fat, especially in me <br>
                    Furthermore, one study found that people who drank one to two cups of coffee per day were 17% more
                    likely to meet recommended physical activity levels, compared with those who drank less than one cup
                    per day
                </p>
                <blockquote>“Coffee could help support weight management and may be linked to decreased body fat. One
                    study also found that people who consumed coffee were more likely to be physically active.”
